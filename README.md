# Project Description
## Overview


In this project, I got familiarised with multiple linear regression. Unlike linear regression, multiple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two or more independent variables and one target / dependent variable. 
 

## Aim

To build a multiple linear regression model in python.

 

 

## Data Description

The dataset used is the soccer player dataset. It has information about various players from different clubs, and it provides data over ten features with a number of goals as the target variable.

 

 

## Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries:  numpy, pandas, statsmodel, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy

 

 

## Approach

* Import the required libraries and dataset

* Check for the correlation between features

* Plot a graph for correlations

* Remove the weakly correlated and highly multicollinear variables

* Perform train test split on the dataset

* Fit the multiple linear regression model

* Convert categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables

* Plot the results
